# KubeConfig


## 1. Where is the default kubeconfig file located in the current environment?


Find the current home directory by looking at the HOME environment variable.

```bash
controlplane ~ ➜  echo $HOME
/root

controlplane ~ ➜  ls .kube/
cache  config

controlplane ~ ➜  ls .kube/config
.kube/config

controlplane ~ ➜  cat .kube/config

## 2. How many clusters are defined in the default kubeconfig file?

1

## 3. How many Users are defined in the default kubeconfig file?

1

## 4. How many contexts are defined in the default kubeconfig file?

1

## 5. What is the user configured in the current context?

user: kubernetes-admin

## 6. What is the name of the cluster configured in the default kubeconfig file?

name: kubernetes ## name of the cluster

## 7. A new kubeconfig file named my-kube-config is created. It is placed in the /root directory. How many clusters are defined in that kubeconfig file?
```bash
controlplane ~ ➜  cat /root/my-kube-config
apiVersion: v1
kind: Config

clusters:
- name: production
  cluster:
    certificate-authority: /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.crt
    server: https://controlplane:6443

- name: development
  cluster:
    certificate-authority: /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.crt
    server: https://controlplane:6443

- name: kubernetes-on-aws
  cluster:
    certificate-authority: /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.crt
    server: https://controlplane:6443

- name: test-cluster-1
  cluster:
    certificate-authority: /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.crt
    server: https://controlplane:6443

contexts:
- name: test-user@development
  context:
    cluster: development
    user: test-user

- name: aws-user@kubernetes-on-aws
  context:
    cluster: kubernetes-on-aws
    user: aws-user

- name: test-user@production
  context:
    cluster: production
    user: test-user

- name: research
  context:
    cluster: test-cluster-1
    user: dev-user # user is configured in the research context

users:
- name: test-user
  user:
    client-certificate: /etc/kubernetes/pki/users/test-user/test-user.crt
    client-key: /etc/kubernetes/pki/users/test-user/test-user.key
- name: dev-user
  user:
    client-certificate: /etc/kubernetes/pki/users/dev-user/developer-user.crt
    client-key: /etc/kubernetes/pki/users/dev-user/dev-user.key
- name: aws-user
  user:
    client-certificate: /etc/kubernetes/pki/users/aws-user/aws-user.crt # the name of the client-certificate file configured for the aws-user
    client-key: /etc/kubernetes/pki/users/aws-user/aws-user.key

current-context: test-user@development #  the current context set to in the my-kube-config file
preferences: {}
```
4

## 8. How many contexts are configured in the my-kube-config file?

4

## 9. What user is configured in the research context?

user: dev-user # user is configured in the research context

## 10. What is the name of the client-certificate file configured for the aws-user?

aws-user.crt

## 11. What is the current context set to in the my-kube-config file?
test-user@development

## 12. I would like to use the ``dev-user`` to access ``test-cluster-1``. Set the current context to the right one so I can do that.

Once the right context is identified, use the ``kubectl config use-context`` command.
- Current context set

Solution: 

To use that context, run the command:
```bash
controlplane ~ ➜  kubectl config --kubeconfig=/root/my-kube-config use-context research
Switched to context "research".
```
To know the current context, run the command
```bash
controlplane ~ ➜  kubectl config --kubeconfig=/root/my-kube-config current-context
research
```
## 13. We don't want to have to specify the kubeconfig file option on each command. Make the ``my-kube-config`` file the default kubeconfig.

Solution : 

```bash
controlplane ~ ✖ mv /root/my-kube-config /root/.kube/config

controlplane ~ ➜  cat /root/.kube/config
apiVersion: v1
clusters:
- cluster:
    certificate-authority: /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.crt
    server: https://controlplane:6443
---
```

```bash
controlplane ~ ➜  k config view
apiVersion: v1
clusters:
- cluster:
    certificate-authority: /etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.crt
    server: https://controlplane:6443
  name: development
----
```

## 14. With the current-context set to research, we are trying to access the cluster. However something seems to be wrong. Identify and fix the issue.

Try running the kubectl get pods command and look for the error. All users certificates are stored at ``/etc/kubernetes/pki/users``.
```bash
- name: dev-user
  user:
    client-certificate: /etc/kubernetes/pki/users/dev-user/developer-user.crt
    client-key: /etc/kubernetes/pki/users/dev-user/dev-user.key
```

```bash
- name: dev-user
  user:
    client-certificate: /etc/kubernetes/pki/users/dev-user/developer-user.crt ## Wrong here 
    client-key: /etc/kubernetes/pki/users/dev-user/dev-user.key
- name: test-user
  user:
    client-certificate: /etc/kubernetes/pki/users/test-user/test-user.crt 
    client-key: /etc/kubernetes/pki/users/test-user/test-user.key

controlplane ~ ➜  vi /root/.kube/config

controlplane ~ ➜  k get nodes
NAME           STATUS   ROLES           AGE   VERSION
