# Solution – Persistent Volumes and Persistent Volume Claims (optional)

## 1. We have deployed a POD. Inspect the POD and wait for it to start running.

In the current(default) namespace
```bash
controlplane ~ ➜  k get pod
NAME     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
webapp   1/1     Running   0          67s
```

## 2. The application stores logs at location ``/log/app.log.`` View the logs.

You can exec in to the container and open the file:

``kubectl exec webapp -- cat /log/app.log``
```bash
controlplane ~ ➜  kubectl exec webapp -- cat /log/app.log
[2023-04-30 10:43:30,200] INFO in event-simulator: USER2 is viewing page1
[2023-04-30 10:43:31,201] INFO in event-simulator: USER3 logged out
[2023-04-30 10:43:32,203] INFO in event-simulator: USER2 is viewing page2
[2023-04-30 10:43:33,204] INFO in event-simulator: USER1 logged in
[2023-04-30 10:43:34,205] INFO in event-simulator: USER2 logged in
[2023-04-30 10:43:35,206] WARNING in event-simulator: USER5 Failed to Login as the account is locked due to MANY FAILED ATTEMPTS.
----
```

## 3. If the POD was to get deleted now, would you be able to view these logs.

Solution 
Pod delete so log deleted

No

## 4. Configure a volume to store these logs at /var/log/webapp on the host.

- Use the spec provided below.
- Name: webapp
- Image Name: kodekloud/event-simulator 
- Volume HostPath: /var/log/webapp
- Volume Mount: /log

```bash
controlplane ~ ➜  k edit pod webapp
```
```yaml
spec:
  containers:
  - env:
    - name: LOG_HANDLERS
      value: file
    image: kodekloud/event-simulator
    imagePullPolicy: Always
    name: event-simulator
    resources: {}
    terminationMessagePath: /dev/termination-log
    terminationMessagePolicy: File
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount
      name: kube-api-access-jdc7s
      readOnly: true
    - mountPath: /log ## add this
      name: log-volume ## add this
  dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
  enableServiceLinks: true
  nodeName: controlplane
  preemptionPolicy: PreemptLowerPriority
  priority: 0
  restartPolicy: Always
  schedulerName: default-scheduler
  securityContext: {}
  serviceAccount: default
  serviceAccountName: default
  terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 30
  tolerations:
  - effect: NoExecute
    key: node.kubernetes.io/not-ready
    operator: Exists
    tolerationSeconds: 300
  - effect: NoExecute
    key: node.kubernetes.io/unreachable
    operator: Exists
    tolerationSeconds: 300
  volumes:
  - hostPath: ## add this
      path: /var/log/webapp ## add this
      type: ""
    name: log-volume ## add this

```
```bash
controlplane ~ ✖ k replace --force -f /tmp/kubectl-edit-2054409513.yaml
pod "webapp" deleted
pod/webapp replaced
```
or 
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: webapp
spec:
  containers:
  - name: event-simulator
    image: kodekloud/event-simulator
    env:
    - name: LOG_HANDLERS
      value: file
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /log
      name: log-volume

  volumes:
  - name: log-volume
    hostPath:
      # directory location on host
      path: /var/log/webapp
      # this field is optional
      type: Directory
```

```bash
controlplane ~ ➜  cat /var/log/webapp/app.log

## 5. Create a Persistent Volume with the given specification.

- Volume Name: pv-log
- Storage: 100Mi
- Access Modes: ReadWriteMany
- Host Path: /pv/log
- Reclaim Policy: Retain

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/


```bash
controlplane ~ ➜  vi pv.yaml

controlplane ~ ➜  k create -f pv.yaml
persistentvolume/pv-log created
```

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: pv-log #
spec:
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain #
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany #
  capacity:
    storage: 100Mi #
  hostPath:
    path: /pv/log #
```

```bash
controlplane ~ ➜  k get pv
NAME     CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   RECLAIM POLICY   STATUS      CLAIM   STORAGECLASS   REASON   AGE
pv-log   100Mi      RWX            Retain           Available                                   12s
```

## 6. Let us claim some of that storage for our application. Create a Persistent Volume Claim with the given specification.
```bash
controlplane ~ ➜  vi pvc.yaml

controlplane ~ ➜  k create -f pvc.yaml
persistentvolumeclaim/claim-log-1 created

controlplane ~ ➜  k get pvc
NAME          STATUS    VOLUME   CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS   AGE
claim-log-1   Pending                                                     3s
```

```yaml
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: claim-log-1 #
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce #
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 50Mi #
~                       
```
## 7. What is the state of the Persistent Volume Claim?
Pending 

## 8. What is the state of the Persistent Volume?
```bash
controlplane ~ ➜  k get pv
NAME     CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   RECLAIM POLICY   STATUS      CLAIM   STORAGECLASS   REASON   AGE
pv-log   100Mi      RWX            Retain           Available                                   2m34s
```

STATUS: Avaible
## 8. Why is the claim not bound to the available Persistent Volume?
Access Modes Mismatch # True because ReadWriteOnce

Reclaim Policy not set correctly

Capacity Mismatch

PV and PVC name mismatch
```bash
controlplane ~ ➜  cat pvc.yaml
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: claim-log-1
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 50Mi
```
## 9. Update the Access Mode on the claim to bind it to the PV.

Delete and recreate the claim-log-1.
- Volume Name: claim-log-1
- Storage Request: 50Mi
- PVol: pv-log
- Status: Bound
```bash
controlplane ~ ➜  k replace --force -f pvc.yaml
persistentvolumeclaim "claim-log-1" deleted
persistentvolumeclaim/claim-log-1 replaced

controlplane ~ ➜  cat pvc.yaml
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: claim-log-1
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany # ReadWriteOnce -> ReadWriteMan
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 50Mi
```
## 10. You requested for 50Mi, how much capacity is now available to the PVC?
```bash
controlplane ~ ➜  k get pvc
NAME          STATUS   VOLUME   CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS   AGE
claim-log-1   Bound    pv-log   100Mi      RWX                           54s
```
100

## 11. Update the ``webapp`` pod to use the persistent volume claim as its storage.

Replace ``hostPath`` configured earlier with the newly created ``PersistentVolumeClaim``.

- Name: webapp
- Image Name: kodekloud/event-simulator
- Volume: PersistentVolumeClaim=claim-log-1
- Volume Mount: /log
```bash

```
