# Init Containers
In a multi-container pod, each container is expected to run a process that stays alive as long as the POD’s lifecycle. For example in the multi-container pod that we talked about earlier that has a web application and logging agent, both the containers are expected to stay alive at all times. The process running in the log agent container is expected to stay alive as long as the web application is running. If any of them fails, the POD restarts.

 

But at times you may want to run a process that runs to completion in a container. For example a process that pulls a code or binary from a repository that will be used by the main web application. That is a task that will be run only one time when the pod is first created. Or a process that waits for an external service or database to be up before the actual application starts. That’s where **initContainers** comes in.

 

An initContainer is configured in a pod like all other containers, except that it is specified inside a **initContainers** section, like this:

```bash
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: myapp-pod
  labels:
    app: myapp
spec:
  containers:
  - name: myapp-container
    image: busybox:1.28
    command: ['sh', '-c', 'echo The app is running! && sleep 3600']
  initContainers:
  - name: init-myservice
    image: busybox
    command: ['sh', '-c', 'git clone <some-repository-that-will-be-used-by-application> ;']
```

When a POD is first created the initContainer is run, and the process in the initContainer must run to a completion before the real container hosting the application starts.

You can configure multiple such initContainers as well, like how we did for multi-pod containers. In that case each init container is run **one at a time in sequential order.**

If any of the initContainers fail to complete, Kubernetes restarts the Pod repeatedly until the Init Container succeeds.

```bash
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: myapp-pod
  labels:
    app: myapp
spec:
  containers:
  - name: myapp-container
    image: busybox:1.28
    command: ['sh', '-c', 'echo The app is running! && sleep 3600']
  initContainers:
  - name: init-myservice
    image: busybox:1.28
    command: ['sh', '-c', 'until nslookup myservice; do echo waiting for myservice; sleep 2; done;']
  - name: init-mydb
    image: busybox:1.28
    command: ['sh', '-c', 'until nslookup mydb; do echo waiting for mydb; sleep 2; done;']
```

Practice

## 1. Identify the pod that has an initContainer configured.

```bash
controlplane ~ ➜  k get pod

2: warm-up1 and warm-up 2

## 6. What is the state of the POD?

Status:           Pending

## 7. How long after the creation of the POD will the application come up and be available to users?

sleep 600 = 10 minute 
sleep 1200 = 20 minute 
Total: 30 minute

## 8. Update the pod red to use an initContainer that uses the busybox image and sleeps for 20 seconds

Delete and re-create the pod if necessary. But make sure no other configurations change.

- Pod: red
- initContainer Configured Correctly

**Hint**: Add initContainers section in the pod spec as below:
```bash
controlplane ~ ➜  k get pod red -o yaml >red.yaml

controlplane ~ ➜  k delete pod red
pod "red" deleted
```

```bash
controlplane ~ ➜  vi red.yaml

controlplane ~ ➜  k apply -f red.yaml
pod/red created
```

## 9. A new application orange is deployed. There is something wrong with it. Identify and fix the issue.

Once fixed, wait for the application to run before checking solution.

```bash
controlplane ~ ➜  k get pod

There is a typo in the command used by the initContainer. To fix this, first get the pod definition file by running kubectl get pod orange -o yaml > /root/orange.yaml.

Next, edit the command and fix the typo.

Then, delete the old pod by running kubectl delete pod orange

Finally, create the pod again by running kubectl create -f /root/orange.yaml

```bash
controlplane ~ ➜  k delete pod orange
pod "orange" deleted

vi orange.yaml 

controlplane ~ ➜  k apply -f orange.yaml
pod/orange created
```
