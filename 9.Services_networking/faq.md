FAQ
While testing the Network Namespaces, if you come across issues where you can’t ping one namespace from the other, make sure you set the NETMASK while setting IP Address. ie: 192.168.1.10/24

ip -n red addr add 192.168.1.10/24 dev veth-red

Another thing to check is FirewallD/IP Table rules. Either add rules to IP Tables to allow traffic from one namespace to another. Or disable IP Tables all together (Only in a learning environment).
