# 5 

Which nodes are these pods placed on?


You must look at all the pods in detail to figure this out.

Run the command **kubectl describe pod newpods-<id>** and look at the node field.

Alternatively run **kubectl get pods -o wide** and check for the node the pod is placed on.

# 9 
Create a new pod with the name redis and with the image redis123.

We use kubectl run command with --dry-run=client -o yaml option to create a manifest file :-
````
root@controlplane:~# kubectl run redis --image=redis123 --dry-run=client -o yaml > redis-definition.yaml
````
After that, using kubectl create -f command to create a resource from the manifest file :-
````
root@controlplane:~# kubectl create -f redis-definition.yaml 
````
Verify the work by running kubectl get command :-
````
root@controlplane:~# kubectl get pods
````

# 10
Now change the image on this pod to redis.

Once done, the pod should be in a running state.

Use the kubectl edit command to update the image of the pod to redis.
````
root@controlplane:~# kubectl edit pod redis
````
If you used a pod definition file then update the image from redis123 to redis in the definition file via Vi or Nano editor and then run kubectl apply command to update the image :-
````
root@controlplane:~# kubectl apply -f redis-definition.yaml 
````
