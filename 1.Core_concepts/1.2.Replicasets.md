# ReplicaSets

## 1. How many PODs exist on the system?


In the current(default) namespace.

```bash
controlplane ~ ➜  k get pod
No resources found in default namespace.
```

## 2. How many ReplicaSets exist on the system?

In the current(default) namespace.
```bash
controlplane ~ ➜  k get replicaset
No resources found in default namespace.
```
0
## 3. How about now? How many ReplicaSets do you see?

We just made a few changes!

```bash
controlplane ~ ➜  k get replicaset
NAME              DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
new-replica-set   4         4         0       7s
```
1

## 4. How many PODs are DESIRED in the new-replica-set?

4

## 5. What is the image used to create the pods in the new-replica-set?
```bash
controlplane ~ ➜  k describe rs new-replica-set

## 6. How many PODs are READY in the new-replica-set?
Pods Status:  0 Running / 4 Waiting / 0 Succeeded / 0 Failed

or 
```bash
controlplane ~ ➜  k get replicaset

## 7. Delete any one of the 4 PODs.
```bash
controlplane ~ ➜  k get pods
NAME                    READY   STATUS             RESTARTS   AGE
new-replica-set-ctvkc   0/1     ImagePullBackOff   0          5m51s
new-replica-set-6m4rx   0/1     ImagePullBackOff   0          5m51s
new-replica-set-b4p4l   0/1     ImagePullBackOff   0          5m51s
new-replica-set-jr5cs   0/1     ErrImagePull       0          5m51s
```
```bash
controlplane ~ ✖ k delete pod new-replica-set-ctvkc
pod "new-replica-set-ctvkc" deleted

```
## 8. How many PODs exist now?
```bash
controlplane ~ ✖ k get pods
NAME                    READY   STATUS             RESTARTS   AGE
new-replica-set-jr5cs   0/1     ImagePullBackOff   0          6m18s
new-replica-set-b4p4l   0/1     ErrImagePull       0          6m18s
new-replica-set-6m4rx   0/1     ImagePullBackOff   0          6m18s
new-replica-set-s2xll   0/1     ErrImagePull       0          12s

```

## 9. Why are there still 4 PODs, even after you deleted one?

ReplicaSet ensures that desired number of PODs always run

## 10. Create a ReplicaSet using the replicaset-definition-1.yaml file located at /root/.

There is an issue with the file, so try to fix it.
- Name: replicaset-1
```bash
controlplane ~ ➜  ls /root
replicaset-definition-1.yaml  sample.yaml
replicaset-definition-2.yaml
```
check
```bash
controlplane ~ ➜  k create -f /root/replicaset-definition-1.yaml
error: resource mapping not found for name: "replicaset-1" namespace: "" from "/root/replicaset-definition-1.yaml": no matches for kind "ReplicaSet" in version "v1"
ensure CRDs are installed first
```
and look
```bash
controlplane ~ ✖ cat /root/replicaset-definition-1.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: replicaset-1
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      tier: frontend
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        tier: frontend
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
```

```bash
controlplane ~ ➜  k explain replicaset
KIND:     ReplicaSet
VERSION:  apps/v1
----
```

```bash
controlplane ~ ➜  vi /root/replicaset-definition-1.yaml

controlplane ~ ➜  k create -f /root/replicaset-definition-1.yaml
replicaset.apps/replicaset-1 created
```

## 11. Fix the issue in the replicaset-definition-2.yaml file and create a ReplicaSet using it.

This file is located at /root/.
- Name: replicaset-2

```bash
controlplane ~ ➜  k create -f /root/replicaset-definition-2.yaml
The ReplicaSet "replicaset-2" is invalid: spec.template.metadata.labels: Invalid value: map[string]string{"tier":"nginx"}: `selector` does not match template `labels`
```

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: replicaset-2
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      tier: frontend
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        tier: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
```
to
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: replicaset-2
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      tier: frontend
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        tier: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
```
or 
```bash
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: replicaset-2
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      tier: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        tier: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
```
## 12. Delete the two newly created ReplicaSets - replicaset-1 and replicaset-2
```bash
controlplane ~ ➜  k get rs
NAME              DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
new-replica-set   4         4         0       17m
replicaset-1      2         2         2       4m7s
replicaset-2      2         2         2       47s
```

```bash
controlplane ~ ✖ k delete rs replicaset-1 replicaset-2
replicaset.apps "replicaset-1" deleted
replicaset.apps "replicaset-2" deleted
```

## 13. Fix the original replica set new-replica-set to use the correct busybox image.

Either delete and recreate the ReplicaSet or Update the existing ReplicaSet and then delete all PODs, so new ones with the correct image will be created.
- Replicas: 4
```bash
controlplane ~ ➜  k edit rs new-replica-set
replicaset.apps/new-replica-set edited
```
change
```yaml
    spec:
      containers:
      - command:
        - sh
        - -c
        - echo Hello Kubernetes! && sleep 3600
        image: busybox777
```
to
```yaml
    spec:
      containers:
      - command:
        - sh
        - -c
        - echo Hello Kubernetes! && sleep 3600
        image: busybox
```
**Hint**: Run the command: kubectl edit replicaset new-replica-set, modify the image name and then save the file.

Delete the previous pods to get the new ones with the correct image.

For this, run the command: kubectl delete po <pod-name>
```bash
controlplane ~ ➜  k get pod
NAME                    READY   STATUS             RESTARTS   AGE
new-replica-set-jr5cs   0/1     ImagePullBackOff   0          24m
new-replica-set-6m4rx   0/1     ImagePullBackOff   0          24m
new-replica-set-b4p4l   0/1     ImagePullBackOff   0          24m
new-replica-set-s2xll   0/1     ImagePullBackOff   0          18m
```

```bash
controlplane ~ ✖ k delete pod new-replica-set-s2xll
pod "new-replica-set-s2xll" deleted

controlplane ~ ➜  k get pod
NAME                    READY   STATUS             RESTARTS   AGE
new-replica-set-ppksk   1/1     Running            0          32s
new-replica-set-jr5cs   0/1     ImagePullBackOff   0          26m
new-replica-set-6m4rx   0/1     ImagePullBackOff   0          26m
new-replica-set-b4p4l   0/1     ImagePullBackOff   0          26m

controlplane ~ ➜  k delete pod new-replica-set-jr5cs new-replica-set-6m4rx new-replica-set-b4p4l
pod "new-replica-set-jr5cs" deleted
pod "new-replica-set-6m4rx" deleted
pod "new-replica-set-b4p4l" deleted
```

```bash
controlplane ~ ➜  k get rs
NAME              DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
new-replica-set   4         4         4       28m

```
## 14. Scale the ReplicaSet to 5 PODs.

Use kubectl scale command or edit the replicaset using kubectl edit replicaset.

**Hint**: Run the command: kubectl edit replicaset new-replica-set, modify the replicas and then save the file OR run: kubectl scale rs new-replica-set --replicas=5 to scale up to 5 PODs.

```bash
controlplane ~ ➜  k scale rs new-replica-set --replicas=5
replicaset.apps/new-replica-set scaled

controlplane ~ ✖ k get pod
NAME                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
new-replica-set-ppksk   1/1     Running   0          3m16s
new-replica-set-xjw6c   1/1     Running   0          2m23s
new-replica-set-ppqlm   1/1     Running   0          2m23s
new-replica-set-ch2d6   1/1     Running   0          2m23s
new-replica-set-x5pwv   1/1     Running   0          17s

controlplane ~ ➜  k get rs
NAME              DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
new-replica-set   5         5         5       29m
```
or 
```bash
k edit rs new-replica-set
```

## 15. ow scale the ReplicaSet down to 2 PODs.

Use the kubectl scale command or edit the replicaset using kubectl edit replicaset.
- 
Replicas: 2
```bash
controlplane ~ ➜  k scale rs new-replica-set --replicas=2
replicaset.apps/new-replica-set scaled
```
No trick haha
