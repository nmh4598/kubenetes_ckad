```

## 6. How many PODs exist on the system now?
```bash
controlplane ~ ➜  k get pod
NAME                                   READY   STATUS             RESTARTS   AGE

```
READY  
  0 
## 7. Out of all the existing PODs, how many are ready?
```bash
controlplane ~ ➜  k describe pod frontend-deployment-7fbf4f5cd9-f42xw

BUSYBOX888

## 8. Why do you think the deployment is not ready?

The image BUSYBOX888 doesn't exist

## 9. Create a new Deployment using the deployment-definition-1.yaml file located at /root/.

There is an issue with the file, so try to fix it.
- 
Name: deployment-1
```bash
controlplane ~ ➜  ls
deployment-definition-1.yaml  sample.yaml

controlplane ~ ➜  k create -f deployment-definition-1.yaml
Error from server (BadRequest): error when creating "deployment-definition-1.yaml": deployment in version "v1" cannot be handled as a Deployment: no kind "deployment" is registered for version "apps/v1" in scheme "k8s.io/apimachinery@v1.26.0-k3s1/pkg/runtime/scheme.go:100"
```

```bash
controlplane ~ ✖ cat deployment-definition-1.yaml
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: deployment
metadata:
  name: deployment-1
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:

  template:

        command:
        - sh
        - "-c"
        - echo Hello Kubernetes! && sleep 3600
```
deployment to Deployment
```bash
controlplane ~ ➜  k create -f deployment-definition-1.yamldeployment.apps/deployment-1 created
```

## 10. Create a new Deployment with the below attributes using your own deployment definition file.

Name: httpd-frontend;
Replicas: 3;
Image: httpd:2.4-alpine
- Name: httpd-frontend
- Replicas: 3
- Image: httpd:2.4-alpine
```bash
controlplane ~ ➜  k create deploy --help
Create a deployment with the specified name.
-----
# Create a deployment named my-dep that runs the nginx image with 3 replicas
  kubectl create deployment my-dep --image=nginx --replicas=3
```

```bash
controlplane ~ ➜  kubectl create deployment httpd-frontend --image=httpd:2.4-alpine --replicas=3
deployment.apps/httpd-frontend created
```

or

Solution manifest file `deployment-definition-httpd.yaml`:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: httpd-frontend
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      name: httpd-frontend
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        name: httpd-frontend
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: httpd-frontend
        image: httpd:2.4-alpine

```
Then run `kubectl create -f deployment-definition-httpd.yaml`


```bash
controlplane ~ ➜  k get deploy
NAME                  READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
deployment-1          0/2     2            0           4m12s
frontend-deployment   0/4     4            0           11m
httpd-frontend        3/3     3            3           20s
```
