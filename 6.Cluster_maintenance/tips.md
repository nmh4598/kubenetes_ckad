Certification Exam Tip!
Here’s a quick tip. In the exam, you won’t know if what you did is correct or not as in the practice tests in this course. You must verify your work yourself. For example, if the question is to create a pod with a specific image, you must run the the kubectl describe pod command to verify the pod is created with the correct name and correct image.
