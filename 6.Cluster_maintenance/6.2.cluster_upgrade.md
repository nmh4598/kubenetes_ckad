# Cluster Upgrade Process

## 1. This lab tests your skills on upgrading a kubernetes cluster. We have a production cluster with applications running on it. Let us explore the setup first.


What is the current version of the cluster?
```bash
controlplane ~ ➜  kubectl get nodes
NAME           STATUS   ROLES           AGE   VERSION
controlplane   Ready    control-plane   73m   v1.25.0
node01         Ready    <none>          72m   v1.25.0
```
v1.25.0
## 2. How many nodes are part of this cluster?

Including controlplane and worker nodes

2

## 3. How many applications are hosted on the cluster?

Count the number of deployments in the default namespace.

```bash
controlplane ~ ➜  k describe node | grep Taints
Taints:             <none>
Taints:             <none>
```

## 4. How many applications are hosted on the cluster?


Count the number of deployments in the default namespace.
```bash
controlplane ~ ➜  k get deploy
NAME   READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
blue   5/5     5            5           2m42s
```

## 5. What nodes are the pods hosted on?

```bash
controlplane ~ ➜  k get pods -o wide
NAME                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE     IP           NODE           NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES
blue-5db6db69f7-2qxrc   1/1     Running   0          3m14s   10.244.0.4   controlplane   <none>           <none>
blue-5db6db69f7-4dw77   1/1     Running   0          3m14s   10.244.1.4   node01         <none>           <none>
blue-5db6db69f7-gvt8v   1/1     Running   0          3m15s   10.244.1.3   node01         <none>           <none>
blue-5db6db69f7-mmsw7   1/1     Running   0          3m15s   10.244.1.2   node01         <none>           <none>
blue-5db6db69f7-spsrc   1/1     Running   0          3m15s   10.244.0.5   controlplane   <none>           <none>
```
controlplane,node01

## 6. You are tasked to upgrade the cluster. Users accessing the applications must not be impacted, and you cannot provision new VMs. What strategy would you use to upgrade the cluster?

**Hint**: In order to ensure minimum downtime, upgrade the cluster one node at a time, while moving the workloads to another node.
In the upcoming tasks you will get to practice how to do that.

Upgrade one node at a time while moving the workloads to the other

Upgrade all nodes at once XXX

Users will be impacted since there is only one worker node XXX

Add new nodes with newer versions while taking down existing nodes XXX

## 7. What is the latest stable version of Kubernetes as of today?

Look at the `remote version` in the output of the `kubeadm upgrade plan` command.

```bash
controlplane ~ ✖ kubeadm upgrade plan
---
[upgrade/versions] Cluster version: v1.25.0
[upgrade/versions] kubeadm version: v1.25.0
---
---
Upgrade to the latest version in the v1.25 series:

COMPONENT                 CURRENT   TARGET
kube-apiserver            v1.25.0   v1.25.9
kube-controller-manager   v1.25.0   v1.25.9
kube-scheduler            v1.25.0   v1.25.9
kube-proxy                v1.25.0   v1.25.9
CoreDNS                   v1.9.3    v1.9.3
etcd                      3.5.4-0   3.5.4-0
---
```
wtf: 1.27.1 

## 8. What is the latest version available for an upgrade with the current version of the kubeadm tool installed?

Use the kubeadm tool

v1.25.9

## 9. We will be upgrading the controlplane node first. Drain the controlplane node of workloads and mark it UnSchedulable
- Controlplane Node: SchedulingDisabled
```bash
controlplane ~ ✖ kubectl drain controlplane --ignore-daemonsets
node/controlplane cordoned
Warning: ignoring DaemonSet-managed Pods: kube-flannel/kube-flannel-ds-kb9dk, kube-system/kube-proxy-bvgpv

```

```bash
controlplane ~ ➜  k get pods -o wide
NAME                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   IP            NODE     NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES

blue-5db6db69f7-gvt8v   1/1     Running   0          10m   10.244.1.3    node01   <none>           <none>

blue-5db6db69f7-vh5ck   1/1     Running   0          27s   10.244.1.8    node01   <none>           <none>
blue-5db6db69f7-w7klw   1/1     Running   0          27s   10.244.1.10   node01   <none>           <none>
```
They are all in node01, so good

## 10. Upgrade the `controlplane` components to exact version `v1.26.0`

Upgrade the kubeadm tool (if not already), then the controlplane components, and finally the kubelet. Practice referring to the Kubernetes documentation page.

Note: While upgrading kubelet, if you hit dependency issues while running the `apt-get upgrade kubelet` command, use the `install kubelet=1.26.0-00` command instead.

- Controlplane Node Upgraded to v1.26.0
- Controlplane Kubelet Upgraded to v1.26.0

**Hint**: Make sure that the correct version of `kubeadm` is installed and then proceed to upgrade the controlplane node. Once this is done, upgrade the `kubelet` on the node.

Solution:
```bash
controlplane ~ ➜  cat /etc/*release
DISTRIB_ID=Ubuntu
DISTRIB_RELEASE=20.04
DISTRIB_CODENAME=focal
DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION="Ubuntu 20.04.5 LTS"
NAME="Ubuntu"
VERSION="20.04.5 LTS (Focal Fossa)"
ID=ubuntu
ID_LIKE=debian
PRETTY_NAME="Ubuntu 20.04.5 LTS"
VERSION_ID="20.04"
HOME_URL="https://www.ubuntu.com/"
SUPPORT_URL="https://help.ubuntu.com/"
BUG_REPORT_URL="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/"
PRIVACY_POLICY_URL="https://www.ubuntu.com/legal/terms-and-policies/privacy-policy"
VERSION_CODENAME=focal
UBUNTU_CODENAME=focal
```

Ubuntu 20.04.5 LTS

On the controlplane node, run the following commands:

This will update the package lists from the software repository.
```bash
apt update
```
This will install the kubeadm version 1.26.0
```bash
apt-get install kubeadm=1.26.0-00
```
This will upgrade Kubernetes controlplane node.
```bash
kubeadm upgrade apply v1.26.0
```
Note that the above steps can take a few minutes to complete.

This will update the `kubelet` with the version `1.26.0`.
```bash
apt-get install kubelet=1.26.0-00 
```
You may need to reload the `daemon` and restart `kubelet` service after it has been upgraded.
```bash
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart kubelet
```

```bash
controlplane ~ ✖ k get node
NAME           STATUS                     ROLES           AGE   VERSION
controlplane   Ready,SchedulingDisabled   control-plane   95m   v1.26.0
node01         Ready
```

## 11. Mark the controlplane node as "Schedulable" again
- Controlplane Node: Ready & Schedulable
```bash
controlplane ~ ➜  kubectl uncordon controlplane
node/controlplane uncordoned

controlplane ~ ➜  k get node
NAME           STATUS   ROLES           AGE   VERSION
controlplane   Ready    control-plane   97m   v1.26.0
node01         Ready    <none>          96m   v1.25.0
```

## 12. Next is the worker node. ``Drain`` the worker node of the workloads and mark it`` UnSchedulable``
- Worker node: Unschedulable

**Hint**: Use the kubectl drain command
```bash
controlplane ~ ➜  kubectl drain node01 --ignore-daemonsets
node/node01 cordoned
Warning: ignoring DaemonSet-managed Pods: kube-flannel/kube-flannel-ds-jtzcp, kube-system/kube-proxy-hx5tj

controlplane ~ ➜  k get nod
error: the server doesn't have a resource type "nod"

controlplane ~ ✖ k get pod -o wide

```

## 13. Upgrade the worker node to the exact version v1.26.0

- Worker Node Upgraded to v1.26.0
- Worker Node Ready

On the node01 node, run the following commands:

If you are on the controlplane node, run `ssh node01` to log in to the `node01`.

This will update the package lists from the software repository.
```bash
controlplane ~ ➜  k get nodes -o wide
NAME           STATUS                     ROLES           AGE    VERSION   INTERNAL-IP    EXTERNAL-IP   OS-IMAGE             KERNEL-VERSION   CONTAINER-RUNTIME
controlplane   Ready                      control-plane   100m   v1.26.0   192.8.165.12   <none>        Ubuntu 20.04.5 LTS   5.4.0-1103-gcp   containerd://1.6.6
node01         Ready,SchedulingDisabled   <none>          99m    v1.25.0   192.8.165.3    <none>        Ubuntu 20.04.5 LTS   5.4.0-1103-gcp   containerd://1.6.6

controlplane ~ ✖ ssh  192.8.165.3

apt-get update
```
This will install the kubeadm version 1.26.0.

```bash
apt-get install kubeadm=1.26.0-00
```
This will upgrade the `node01` configuration.
```bash
kubeadm upgrade node
```
This will update the `kubelet` with the version `1.26.0`.
```bash
apt-get install kubelet=1.26.0-00 
```
You may need to reload the `daemon` and restart `kubelet` service after it has been upgraded.
```bash
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart kubelet
```
Type `exit` or `logout` or enter `CTRL + d` to go back to the controlplane node.


## 14. Remove the restriction and mark the worker node as schedulable again.

```bash
exit
kubectl uncordon node01
```
