# Jobs

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/

## 1. A pod definition file named throw-dice-pod.yaml is given. The image throw-dice randomly returns a value between 1 and 6. 6 is considered success and all others are failure. Try deploying the POD and view the POD logs for the generated number.

File is located at /root/throw-dice-pod.yaml

- Pod Name: throw-dice-pod
- Image Name: kodekloud/throw-dice

```bash
controlplane ~ ➜  ls
throw-dice-pod.yaml

controlplane ~ ➜  cat throw-dice-pod.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: throw-dice-pod
spec:
  containers:
  -  image: kodekloud/throw-dice
     name: throw-dice
  restartPolicy: Never

controlplane ~ ➜  k apply -f throw-dice-pod.yaml
pod/throw-dice-pod created
k
controlplane ~ ➜  k get pod
NAME             READY   STATUS   RESTARTS   AGE
throw-dice-pod   0/1     Error    0          7s

controlplane ~ ✖ k logs throw-dice-pod
4
```

## 2. Create a Job using this POD definition file or from the imperative command and look at how many attempts does it take to get a '6'.

Use the specification given on the below.
- Job Name: throw-dice-job
- Image Name: kodekloud/throw-dice

```bash
controlplane ~ ✖ vi throw-dice-job.yaml
````
Use the following YAML file to create the job:
````yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: throw-dice-job
spec:
  backoffLimit: 15 # This is so the job does not quit before it succeeds.
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: throw-dice
        image: kodekloud/throw-dice
      restartPolicy: Never
````
````bash
controlplane ~ ➜  k apply -f throw-dice-job.yaml
job.batch/throw-dice-job created
````

```bash
controlplane ~ ✖ k describe job throw-dice-job
Name:             throw-dice-job

```

or

Run the command:
```bash
 kubectl create job throw-dice-job --image=kodekloud/throw-dice --dry-run=client -o yaml > throw-dice-job.yaml 
```
to create a job definition file.

## 3 Monitor and wait for the job to succeed. Throughout this practice test remember to increase the 'BackOffLimit' to prevent the job from quitting before it succeeds.

Check out the documentation page about the BackOffLimit property.

- Job Name: throw-dice-job
- Image Name: kodekloud/throw-dice
- Job Succeeded: True

## 4. Update the job definition to run as many times as required to get 3 successful 6's.

Delete existing job and create a new one with the given spec. Monitor and wait for the job to succeed.

- Job Name: throw-dice-job
- Image Name: kodekloud/throw-dice
- Completions: 3
- Job Succeeded: True

```bash
controlplane ~ ➜  vi throw-dice-job.yaml
```
You can use the following YAML file:
```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: throw-dice-job
spec:
  completions: 3
  backoffLimit: 25 # This is so the job does not quit before it succeeds.
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: throw-dice
        image: kodekloud/throw-dice
      restartPolicy: Never
```

```bash
controlplane ~ ➜  k describe job throw-dice-job

```

## 5. How many attempts did it take to complete the job this time?
6

## 6. That took a while. Let us try to speed it up, by running upto 3 jobs in parallel.

Update the job definition to run 3 jobs in parallel.
```bash
controlplane ~ ➜  k describe job throw-dice-job
Name:             throw-dice-job
Namespace:        default

```

## 7. Let us now schedule that job to run at 21:30 hours every day.

Create a CronJob for this.

```bash
controlplane ~ ➜  vi throw-dice-cron-job.yaml

controlplane ~ ➜  k apply -f throw-dice-cron-job.yaml
cronjob.batch/throw-dice-cron-job created
```

```bash
controlplane ~ ✖ k describe cronjob throw-dice-cron-job
