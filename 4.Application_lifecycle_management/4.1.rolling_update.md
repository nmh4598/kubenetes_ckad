# Rolling update

## 1. We have deployed a simple web application. Inspect the PODs and the Services



Wait for the application to fully deploy and view the application using the link called Webapp Portal above your terminal.

```bash
controlplane ~ ➜  k get pod
NAME                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
frontend-6fb456676-v2xlz   1/1     Running   0          3m21s
frontend-6fb456676-pjw5t   1/1     Running   0          3m21s
frontend-6fb456676-vn986   1/1     Running   0          3m21s
frontend-6fb456676-d4fb2   1/1     Running   0          3m21s
```

## 2. What is the current color of the web application?
Access the Webapp Portal.

blue

## 3. Run the script named curl-test.sh to send multiple requests to test the web application. Take a note of the output.

Execute the script at /root/curl-test.sh.
```bash
controlplane ~ ➜  ./curl-test.sh
Hello, Application Version: v1 ; Color: blue OK

Hello, Application Version: v1 ; Color: blue OK

Hello, Application Version: v1 ; Color: blue OK

Hello, Application Version: v1 ; Color: blue OK
```
## 4. Inspect the deployment and identify the number of PODs deployed by it

Run the command 
```bash
controlplane ~ ✖ kubectl describe deployment
Name:                   frontend
Namespace:              default
CreationTimestamp:      Fri, 28 Apr 2023 18:42:00 +0000

controlplane ~ ➜  k get deploy

frontend   4/4     4            4           5m50s
```
and look at Desired Replicas
4

## 5. What container image is used to deploy the applications?

Image:        kodekloud/webapp-color:v1

## 6. Inspect the deployment and identify the current strategy

RollingUpdate

## 7. If you were to upgrade the application now what would happen?

Pods are upgraded few at a time

## 8. Let us try that. Upgrade the application by setting the image on the deployment to kodekloud/webapp-color:v2

Do not delete and re-create the deployment. Only set the new image name for the existing deployment.

- Deployment Name: frontend
- Deployment Image: kodekloud/webapp-color:v2

**Hint**: 
Run the command kubectl edit deployment frontend and modify the image to kodekloud/webapp-color:v2.
Next, save and exit. The pods should be recreated with the new image.


or
```bash
controlplane ~ ✖ k set image deploy frontend simple-webapp=kodekloud/webapp-color:v2
deployment.apps/frontend image updated
```
## 9. Run the script curl-test.sh again. Notice the requests now hit both the old and newer versions. However none of them fail.

Execute the script at /root/curl-test.sh.

```bash
controlplane ~ ➜  ./curl-test.shHello, Application Version: v2 ; Color: green OK

Hello, Application Version: v2 ; Color: green OK

Hello, Application Version: v2 ; Color: green OK

Hello, Application Version: v2 ; Color: green OK

Hello, Application Version: v2 ; Color: green OK

Hello, Application Version: v2 ; Color: green OK

Hello, Application Version: v2 ; Color: green OK

Hello, Application Version: v1 ; Color: blue OK

Hello, Application Version: v2 ; Color: green OK

Hello, Application Version: v2 ; Color: green OK

Hello, Application Version: v1 ; Color: blue OK

Hello, Application Version: v1 ; Color: blue OK

Hello, Application Version: v2 ; Color: green OK

Hello, Application Version: v2 ; Color: green OK

Hello, Application Version: v2 ; Color: green OK

Hello, Application Version: v2 ; Color: green OK

Hello, Application Version: v2 ; Color: green OK

Hello, Application Version: v2 ; Color: green OK

Hello, Application Version: v2 ; Color: green OK

Hello, Application Version: v2 ; Color: green OK
```

## 10. Up to how many PODs can be down for upgrade at a time

Consider the current strategy settings and number of PODs - 4

1

## 11. Change the deployment strategy to Recreate

Delete and re-create the deployment if necessary. Only update the strategy type for the existing deployment.

- Deployment Name: frontend
- Deployment Image: kodekloud/webapp-color:v2
- Strategy: Recreate

**Hint**: Run the command `kubectl edit deployment` frontend and modify the required field. Make sure to delete the properties of rollingUpdate as well, set at `strategy.rollingUpdate`

```bash
controlplane ~ ✖ k edit deploy frontend
```

```yaml
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
```
## 12. Upgrade the application by setting the image on the deployment to kodekloud/webapp-color:v3

Do not delete and re-create the deployment. Only set the new image name for the existing deployment.
- Deployment Name: frontend
- Deployment Image: kodekloud/webapp-color:v3

**Hint**: Run the command: kubectl edit deployment frontend and modify the image to kodekloud/webapp-color:v3.
Next, save and exit. The pods should be recreated with the new image.

Note that all pods will be terminated and recreated simultaneously this time.
